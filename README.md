# Operating Systems AI Labs

Welcome to the Operating Systems AI Labs repository! This project provides hands-on lab exercises to explore Operating System concepts using modern tools like GitHub Copilot and automated assessment.

## Labs Included
- **Lab1_CPU_Scheduling** – Learn and implement CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority).
- **Lab2_Memory_Management** – Explore paging and memory algorithms (LRU, FIFO, Optimal).
- **Lab3_File_System** – Simulate file system allocation and operations.

## Copilot-Powered Learning
Each lab contains:
- Starter code and templates
- Copilot prompt suggestions
- Guidance on using Copilot for code generation, debugging, and review

## Assessment & Automation
- GitHub Actions for auto-testing code submissions
- Rubrics for Copilot prompt quality and code originality
