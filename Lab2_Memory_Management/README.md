# Lab 2: Memory Management & Paging Algorithms

## Overview
Implement and analyze memory management algorithms:
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Optimal Page Replacement

## Instructions
- Complete the starter code in `paging.py`.
- Use Copilot prompts in `Copilot_Prompts.md` for simulation and analysis.
- Compare hit/miss rates for different algorithms.

## Submission
- Completed code
- Copilot Prompt Log
- Reflection report
